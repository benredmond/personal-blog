# Site URL Configuration
# Required for OpenGraph meta tags (og:url, og:image) to use absolute URLs
# Social platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) require absolute URLs for previews

# Set this in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# For production: Use your custom domain or Vercel subdomain
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# For local development: Defaults to localhost if not set
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Note: If NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is not set, the app will fall back to:
# 1. VERCEL_URL (auto-set by Vercel in preview/production)
# 2. http://localhost:3000 (development fallback)
